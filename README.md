# Unchained

![Logo](/Images/githublogo.png)

Practise app made with React Native called Unchained. This app aims to create an easy-to-read list of nearby cafes, with information on distance and open-times, with cafes that are part of chain groups (e.g. Costa, Starbucks) filtered out. Below you will find a diagram outlining the tech-stack/Apis/software used. The project can be pulled, but apikeys for the database, google maps api and google ads will need to be replaced.

Here are two pictures to show what the app looks like, from the home screen and a successful search screen (up to 20 results).

Thanks for out my first React Native app! Hopefully there will be more in the future. 
In terms of future direction for this app, as of march, once the google ads are approved I will hopefully upload the app on the google play store so my friends can use it, and possibly develop the ios version. I will also look into applying the same concept for restaurant and shopping results too.
